The patient consents to undergo a liver transplant procedure. The procedure involves the surgical removal of the diseased liver and replacement with a donor organ.

Following the surgery, immunosuppressant therapy may be required to prevent organ rejection. Immunosuppressive medications reduce the activity of the immune system, which may increase susceptibility to infections.

Potential adverse effects include infection, bleeding, organ rejection, and complications related to anesthesia. These risks may vary depending on the patient's medical condition.

The patient acknowledges that the duration of hospital stay may be prolonged and that recovery time can differ from person to person.

In some cases, additional surgical interventions may be necessary if complications arise. There is no guarantee of successful outcome.

The patient understands that lifelong follow-up and regular medical monitoring may be required after the transplant procedure.
